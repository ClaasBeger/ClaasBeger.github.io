I am currently a Graduate Fellow at Santa Fe Institute, doing research on multimodal reasoning under Professor [Melanie Mitchell](https://melaniemitchell.me/). Prior to that I finished my Master's in Computer Science at Cornell University, where I worked with [Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/), [Kilian Weinberger](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/) and [Saikat Dutta](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~saikatd/). My research interest centers broadly around Human-like Artificial Intelligence. For this purpose, I think it is the most promising direction to look towards Natural Intelligence, both with regard to the brain and psychology/cognition.

I am applying to PhD programs for the fall 2025 cycle.
