## Vaible.Space: Real-Time Reservation Platform

During an entrepreneurship course at the Technical University of Munich, I collaborated with fellow students to develop Vaible.Space - a real-time reservation system for restaurants, bars, and cafes.

### Project Overview

Vaible.Space addresses the common frustration of finding available seating at popular venues. Our platform provides users with real-time information about venue capacity and allows them to make instant reservations, while giving businesses a simple way to manage their space and attract customers during slower periods.

### Technical Implementation

Our team developed a progressive web application that works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices. The technology stack included:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Nuxt.js framework
- **Backend**: Firebase for real-time database and authentication
- **Mapping**: Google Maps API for location-based services
- **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration

### Key Features

- Real-time venue capacity indicators
- Location-based venue discovery
- Instant reservation system
- Business analytics for venue owners
- Mobile-optimized interface

### Entrepreneurial Experience

Beyond the technical development, this project provided valuable experience in:
- Market research and product validation
- Business model development
- Pitching to potential investors
- User experience design

This entrepreneurial project combined technical development with business planning, giving me insight into the full lifecycle of bringing a product from concept to market.
