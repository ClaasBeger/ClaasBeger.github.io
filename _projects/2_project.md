## Industrial Robot Orchestration System

As part of the iPraktikum applied course at the Technical University of Munich, I collaborated with a team of student developers on an industry partnership project with Siemens.

### Project Overview

Our team was tasked with creating an orchestration system for industrial robots, addressing the complex challenge of managing both autonomous and non-autonomous agents within the same industrial environment.

### My Contribution

Within this project, I took primary responsibility for developing the auctioning algorithm - a critical component of the system that optimally matches tasks and requests between different agents in the industrial environment. This algorithm needed to:

- Efficiently distribute workloads across available robots
- Prioritize time-sensitive tasks
- Handle conflicts between autonomous and manual operations
- Adapt to changing conditions on the factory floor

The implementation required careful consideration of both technical constraints and real-world industrial workflows, ensuring the system would be practical in actual manufacturing environments.

### Development Process

Working in close collaboration with industry professionals from Siemens, our team followed professional software development methodologies including:

- Agile development with regular sprint reviews
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
- Client-centered design thinking
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

The practical experience gained through this industry collaboration provided valuable insights into developing enterprise-grade applications that meet rigorous industry standards.
